# IsotechB200

This github contains the source files of the Amsterdam University of Applied Science innovationlab assignment: B-200 ADC substitution.

With the data in this repository one can recreate the design made for the project and utilize this as a Jump-off point for further development.

# CODE
Contains a sample code showing how to use the Interface with a digital Microcontroller. In this case a regular Arduino UNO.

# EAGLE
Contains Autodesk Eagle board files. Which includes circuit schematic and PCB design.

# LTSPICE
Contains the LTSPICE Simulation file used for simulating the analog component of the Interface board

# doc
Contains the PDF and source LaTeX files behind the research. For documentation referencing purposes.
